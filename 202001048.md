                                                          Question 1: Library Information System (LIS)
                                                          
# Question 1. Identify FRs and NFRs: 
**Identification of Functional requirements**  
1) **Registration of new User :** Any institute member who wants to use the library's services must register with the system for library resources. The member would receive a user ID and password after successfully registering. For any upcoming Library Information System transaction, he must use these credentials.
2) **Searching of Books :** Any Library Information System user (even non-members) may use this service to determine whether a specific book is kept in the institute's library. One could look up a book using: Title, Author, Publisherâ€™s name, ISBN number.
3) **Login of User :** A registered Library Information System user can access the system by entering the employee ID and password he chose during registration. The user is taken to the "Home" page, where he or she can access the various Library Information System features after successful login: book search, book issue, book return, and book reissue. The login dialog would reappear and a login failure message would be displayed to any employee ID that is not registered with LIS. The same thing occurs when a registered user enters the wrong password. However, if an incorrect password is provided three times in a row, the security question that the user specified when registering is displayed along with an input box for answering it. A new password would be sent to the user's email address in the event that the security question is correctly answered. His LIS account would be blocked if the user did not correctly answer the security question. To make it active once more, he needs to get in touch with the administrator.
4) **Issuing a Book :** Any Library Information System member can issue book to his account as long as:  
a) The book is in the library, so you can find it by searching for it in Library Information System.  
b) No other member has issued the book at this time.  
c) The current user has not issued the maximum number of books that can be issued.  
If the aforementioned requirements are met, the book is given to the member.Keep in mind that the definition of "maximum books allowed to be issued to a member" would leave this FR incomplete. We assume that this number has been set at ten for professors and four for students and research scholars.
The user account is updated to reflect the successful issuance of a book.
5) **Returning a Book :** A book is only available for a certain amount of time, which we will assume to be fourteen days. That is, the corresponding member of LIS must return the book within the next fourteen days after it has been issued. This return day period can be different for different genres of Books, for eg: Fiction, Business, Academic. The user account is updated to reflect the successful return of a book. If the book if not returned within the permissible duration a fine would be charged according to the Library Policy.
6) **Reissuing a Book :** It's possible that any member who has issued a book will discover that his requirement has not been met by fourteen days. If that is the case, he might decide to reissue the book and obtain permission to keep it for an additional fourteen days. However, a member can only reissue a book thrice before having to return it. The information in the user account is updated once a book has been successfully reissued.
7) **Add/Drop Books :** The Library Information System's admin only would have access to this feature. Admin would be able to add new book and also delete books from the system when required.

**Identification of Non-Functional requirements**  
1) **Performance Requirements :** The Library Information System server would be able to perform desired tasks in reasonable unit of time. At least 200 users should be able to access the system altogether at any given time. This system should remain accessible 24x7.
2) **Security Requirements :** Only authorized users would have access to the system. Only the institute's LAN should have access to this system. Passwords cannot be stored in plain text in the LIS database instead, a hashed value must be stored.
3) **Different Roles and Features :** Administrators will have no trouble keeping track of clients' log-in times with our proposed system.
4) **Design Constraints :** The LIS must be developed as a web application that is compatible with Firefox 4, Internet Explorer 7, Google Chrome 10, Opera 9, and later versions of the aforementioned web-browsers.
5) **Accessibility and Ease-of-use :** The proposed system would offer a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and be simple to use. The proposed system would be GUI-based desktop application installed on computing root node (server) running the application.
6) **Reliability :** As expected, the Server would carry out the desired operations. The system performs its functions with greater precision, including user registration, user validation and authorization, book search and issue operation, return status, and database updates by synchronizing between application and database.
7) **Maintainability :** Maintaining and expanding the proposed system would not be difficult. The running application would not be harmed by even the smallest system modification.

                              Question 2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
                              
# Question 2. : Identify Scope, Features and Non-functional aspects

1) **Scope :** The main scope of the project is to develop an application for the people suffering from hearing loss. It will be mainly beneficial to fulfill their daily needs of safe travel and communication. As they are approximately 5% of the total world population, this application would have a huge user base and would also enjoy Government's support as it will be for the betterment of the society. It will be a very impactful solution as it would be a real time based system and a medium of interaction between user and surroundings.
2) **Features :** Our mobile application will use artificial intelligence(Al) to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies. These will overall comprise of the immediate alerts and continual logging which are critical to the user. The system will use different color schemes for immediate alerts, the system will keep track of the behavior and alerts and send them to any of its family memebers or colleagues so that they could take necessary steps. The system will be directly linked to Governments network so that they could implement policies for their safety.
3) **Non Functional Aspects :** The application should be optimized in Android. The application should have low latency so that it works in real time
