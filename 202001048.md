# Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs: 
Identification of Functional requirements  
1) **Registration of new User :** Any institute member who wants to use the library's services must register with the system for library resources. The member would receive a user ID and password after successfully registering. For any upcoming LIS transaction, he must use these credentials.
2) **Searching of Books :** Any Library Information System user (even non-members) may use this service to determine whether a specific book is kept in the institute's library. One could look up a book using: Title, Author, Publisherâ€™s name, ISBN number.
3) **Login of User :** A registered Library Information System user can access the system by entering the employee ID and password he chose during registration. The user is taken to the "Home" page, where he or she can access the various Library Information System features after successful login: book search, book issue, book return, and book reissue. The login dialog would reappear and a login failure message would be displayed to any employee ID that is not registered with LIS. The same thing occurs when a registered user enters the wrong password. However, if an incorrect password is provided three times in a row, the security question that the user specified when registering is displayed along with an input box for answering it. A new password would be sent to the user's email address in the event that the security question is correctly answered. His LIS account would be blocked if the user did not correctly answer the security question. To make it active once more, he needs to get in touch with the administrator.
4) **Issuing a Book :** Any Library Information System member can issue book to his account as long as:  
a) The book is in the library, so you can find it by searching for it in Library Information System.  
b) No other member has issued the book at this time.  
c) The current user has not issued the maximum number of books that can be issued.  
If the aforementioned requirements are met, the book is given to the member.Keep in mind that the definition of "maximum books allowed to be issued to a member" would leave this FR incomplete. We assume that this number has been set at ten for professors and four for students and research scholars.
The user account is updated to reflect the successful issuance of a book.
5) **Returning a Book :** A book is only available for a certain amount of time, which we will assume to be fourteen days. That is, the corresponding member of LIS must return the book within the next fourteen days after it has been issued. This return day period can be different for different genres of Books, for eg: Fiction, Business, Academic. The user account is updated to reflect the successful return of a book. If the book if not returned within the permissible duration a fine would be charged according to the Library Policy.
6) **Reissuing a Book :** It's possible that any member who has issued a book will discover that his requirement has not been met by fourteen days. If that is the case, he might decide to reissue the book and obtain permission to keep it for an additional fourteen days. However, a member can only reissue a book thrice before having to return it. The information in the user account is updated once a book has been successfully reissued.
